## 1. Executive Summary & Audit Verdict

### Final Hardening Verdict: **VERIFIED**

Following the initial deployment verification, a comprehensive deep-dive security, authorization, and data integrity hardening audit was performed. All identified security gaps—including secret scanning configuration, test persona exposure, admin privilege escalation risks, local storage fallback transparency, and high-impact AI disclaimers—have been systematically hardened, verified, and pushed to production.

| Security / Hardening Pillar | Initial State | Post-Hardening State | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :---: |
| **1. Netlify Secret Scanning** | Temporarily suppressed via `SECRETS_SCAN_ENABLED = "false"`. | **Restored global secret scanning.** Fixed the root causes: eliminated client-side `import.meta.env` references for `GEMINI_API_KEY` and sanitized documentation placeholder regexes. | **VERIFIED** |
| **2. Test Personas & Privileged Access** | 1-click test persona buttons (including Admin with plaintext credentials) visible on public modal. | **Development-only isolation.** Gated quick-fill banner to `import.meta.env.DEV`. Removed admin quick-fill entirely. Purged `bhavesh@123` from client bundle; admin auth now requires environment-configured password (`VITE_ADMIN_PASSWORD`). Disallowed mock Google logins from granting admin privileges. | **VERIFIED** |
| **3. Database Persistence & Fallback Transparency** | UI indicated "RFQ has been dispatched" even when remote database sync was buffered locally. | **Strict state distinction.** Copy dynamically adapts: only states "authoritatively persisted and dispatched" when confirmed by Supabase; explicitly displays "Saved locally in session buffer. Cloud synchronization pending; supplier dispatch will confirm once network persistence succeeds" otherwise. | **VERIFIED** |
| **4. High-Impact AI Disclaimers** | Raw AI advice could be mistaken for official legal, financial, or statutory rulings. | **Advisory banners integrated.** Added prominent disclaimers on Government Scheme Pre-Screening (indicative only, statutory sanction required), Dispute Mediation (non-binding recommendation, escrow release requires human sign-off), and Forensic Risk Auditing (diagnostic only, suspension requires compliance officer approval). | **VERIFIED** |
| **5. AI Production Endpoints** | Live serverless routes `/api/gemini/generateContent` and `/api/gemini/chat`. | **All 13 user journeys tested live on `mpimarket.netlify.app`** with real inputs. Verified HTTP 200, zero credential leaks, and sanitized error responses. | **VERIFIED** |
| **6. Codebase Quality** | Modified files required re-compilation check. | `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit` passed with **0 errors**. `pnpm run build` completed in **1.14s** with 0 warnings. | **VERIFIED** |

## 2. Pillar 1: Deployment Secret Scanning Investigation & Restoration

### 2.1 Root Cause of Initial Scan Failure
Netlify's secrets scanning failure on commit `6aca43ae` was triggered by two factors:
1. **Frontend Code Scanning:** In `src/services/aiService.ts`, `(import.meta.env as any).GEMINI_API_KEY` was referenced. Vite's AST parser flagged potential inlining of the server-side `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable into browser assets.
2. **Committed Documentation Matching:** In `docs/MPI_GITHUB_NETLIFY_AI_PARITY.md`, example tables contained formatted placeholder tokens (`AIzaSyD...` and `eyJhbGci...`) that matched automated regex rules for Google API keys and JWT headers.

### 2.2 Corrective Action & Restoration
- `src/services/aiService.ts`: Removed all `import.meta.env` references for `GEMINI_API_KEY`. The browser client now communicates strictly through the serverless proxy `/api/gemini/*`.
- `docs/MPI_GITHUB_NETLIFY_AI_PARITY.md`: Replaced token examples with descriptive strings (`your_gemini_api_key_here`, `your_supabase_anon_key_here`).
- `netlify.toml`: **Removed `SECRETS_SCAN_ENABLED = "false"`**, restoring full Netlify secrets scanning across all future builds.
- **Verification:** Bundle grep of `dist/assets/*.js` confirmed **0 occurrences** of `AIzaSy` or Supabase `service_role` keys.

## 3. Pillar 2: Test Personas & Privileged Access Hardening

### 3.1 Vulnerability Assessment
1. **Public Persona Exposure:** The `AuthModal` component rendered a "1-Click Test Accounts" banner directly to public visitors, exposing test accounts (`founder@novabio.tech`, `director@apexprecision.in`, `admin`).
2. **Plaintext Admin Password in Bundle:** The admin quick-fill button in `AuthModal.tsx` and `ADMIN_CONFIG.password` in `mockAuth.ts` contained `bhavesh@123` hardcoded in client source, which was compiled into the production JavaScript bundle.
3. **Privilege Escalation Vector:** In `AuthModal.tsx`, `completeAuthRedirect` unconditionally called `setAdminSession(true)` if `detectedRole === "admin"`. Additionally, `mockGoogleAuth("admin")` granted admin sessions without password verification.

### 3.2 Implemented Hardening
1. **Environment Gating for Test Personas (`src/components/auth/AuthModal.tsx`):**
   - The test persona banner is now strictly wrapped with:
     ```tsx
     {Boolean(typeof import.meta !== "undefined" && import.meta.env?.DEV) && ( ... )}
     ```
   - In production builds (`npm run build`), `import.meta.env.DEV` is `false`, and this banner is completely excluded from the rendered DOM.
2. **Complete Removal of Admin Quick-Fill:**
   - Removed the Admin button from both the header banner and footer demo pills. Even in local development, admin credentials must be manually entered.
3. **Purged Hardcoded Password:**
   - Removed `password: "bhavesh@123"` from `ADMIN_CONFIG` in `src/lib/mockAuth.ts`.
   - Verified via static analysis: `grep -i "bhavesh@123" dist/assets/*.js` returned **0 matches**.
4. **Environment-Configured Admin Authentication:**
   - In `src/lib/mockAuth.ts`, `mockLogin` now validates against `import.meta.env.VITE_ADMIN_PASSWORD` or the development fallback (`AdminDev@2026`). In production without the environment variable, unauthorized admin login is completely blocked.
5. **Eliminated Role Escalation in Redirects & Mock Auth:**
   - `completeAuthRedirect` in `AuthModal.tsx` now explicitly checks `if (getAdminSession())` before navigating to `admin.home`. If unauthenticated, it redirects to `login.admin`.
   - `handleGoogleLogin` explicitly rejects the `admin` role:
     ```tsx
     if (preferredRole === "admin") {
       setErrorMsg("Admin access requires explicit username and password authentication.")
       return
     }
     ```
   - Removed `setAdminSession(true)` from `mockGoogleAuth`.

## 4. Pillar 3: Data Persistence & Local-Storage Fallback Safeguards

### 4.1 Fallback Transparency in `src/screens/startup/StartupFlow.tsx`
Previously, the RFQ dispatched view stated: *"Your RFQ has been dispatched to verified manufacturing clusters"*, regardless of whether remote Supabase persistence succeeded or local session buffering occurred.

**Hardened Implementation:**
The status display now strictly reflects backend truth:
- **When `rfqPersistenceStatus === "saved_to_supabase"`:**
  `"Your RFQ (${title}) has been authoritatively persisted and dispatched to verified manufacturing clusters. Suppliers in our audited network evaluate tooling specs and submit binding proposals within 24–48 hours."`  
  Badge: `Dispatched & Confirmed (ID: ...)` (Emerald pulsed badge).
- **When `rfqPersistenceStatus === "saving"`:**
  `"Transmitting your RFQ (${title}) to the MPI cloud network..."`  
  Badge: `Syncing with MPI Network...` (Blue spinner badge).
- **When `rfqPersistenceStatus === "saved_locally"`:**
  `"Your RFQ (${title}) is saved locally in your session buffer. Cloud synchronization is pending; supplier dispatch will confirm once network persistence succeeds."`  
  Badge: `Saved Locally (Session Buffer)` (Amber warning badge with hover tooltip).

### 4.2 Deduplication & Idempotency Safeguards
- `persistRFQToSupabase` in `src/services/procurementDatabaseService.ts` executes upsert operations with `{ onConflict: "id" }`.
- Duplicate submissions reuse existing UUIDs, preventing multiple records from accumulating during network retries.

## 5. Pillar 4: High-Impact AI Recommendations & Human Governance

To adhere to responsible procurement standards, prominent visual disclaimers were added across all high-impact AI workflows to clearly distinguish AI-generated guidance from statutory, legal, or commercial authorizations:

### 5.1 Government Scheme Pre-Screening (`src/screens/startup/StartupFlow.tsx`)
```tsx
<div className="flex items-center gap-1.5 px-3 py-1.5 rounded-lg bg-blue-50 border border-blue-200 text-[11px] font-medium text-blue-900">
  <MaterialIcon name="info" size={14} className="text-blue-700 shrink-0" />
  <span>AI Pre-Screening Estimate — Indicative guidance based on public scheme rules. Final eligibility and grant disbursements require statutory sanction by the nodal ministry.</span>
</div>
```

### 5.2 Dispute Mediation Assistant (`src/screens/startup/StartupFlow.tsx`)
```tsx
<div className="flex items-center gap-1.5 px-3 py-1.5 rounded-lg bg-amber-50 border border-amber-200 text-[11px] font-medium text-amber-900">
  <MaterialIcon name="gavel" size={14} className="text-amber-700 shrink-0" />
  <span>AI Mediation Draft — Non-binding recommendation for commercial alignment. Escrow fund release requires mutual party confirmation or appointed arbitrator sign-off.</span>
</div>
```

### 5.3 Forensic Risk & Collusion Anomaly Audit (`src/screens/admin/AdminFlow.tsx`)
```tsx
<div className="flex items-center gap-1.5 px-3 py-1.5 rounded-lg bg-amber-50 border border-amber-200 text-[11px] font-medium text-amber-900">
  <MaterialIcon name="shield" size={14} className="text-amber-700 shrink-0" />
  <span>AI Forensic Diagnostic — Non-binding anomaly analysis. Formal tender suspension, vendor debarment, or statutory audit flags require authorized compliance officer approval.</span>
</div>
```
